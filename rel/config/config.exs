use Mix.Config

# This file is used for configuring the Mebe2 release after release generation time. You can
# override settings that were set during release compilation time using this file by copying the
# settings over and setting a new value for them.

# Example:
#     config :mebe_2,
#       data_path: "/foo/bar"

# Note: Some settings can be also configured by using environment variables. The values from env
# vars will overwrite the values set here.
